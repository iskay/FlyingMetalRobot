This is a shump written to teach myself about Flash, Flex and ActionScript. It uses the very excellent open-source Flixel library <http://flixel.org> written by Adam Atomic.

The graphics are partially original, but mostly use modified sprites from SpriteLib GPL <http://flyingyogi.com/fun/spritelib.html> by Ari Feldman and the demo projects included with Flixel. The sound effects were created by yours truly (feel free to use them however you like).


Instructions:
 x - activate jetpack
 c - fire mustard balls
 z - fire bazooka (limited ammo and splash damage)

 All you have to do is fly around and kill as many godforsaken space aliens as you can. Kill enough, and you'll get to face the big artillery. The level is randomly generated as you go; there's no end, mainly because the game is so much fun that no one will ever want to stop anyway.

Go now, and Godspeed!
